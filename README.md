Hi there and welcome to Kids-Playtime

The aim of this application is to facilitate parents in inventing creative ways to play/interact with their children. 
Inspired by my colleague's statement that "coming up with games to play with children instead of handing them a phone to occupy themselves is about as challenging as figuring out what to have for dinner for another consecutive day," 
and the growing popularity of content generation using ChatGPT, I decided to combine these two elements and create an application that addresses the needs of parents struggling to maintain a high level of creativity :).

The app's interface is primarily built on the screen of my iPad, but it slowly makes its way into the app using SwiftUI. Here are a few screens from the app:
